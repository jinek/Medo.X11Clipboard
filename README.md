Medo.X11Clipboard
=================

X11Clipboard library is designed for applications that need to interact with the
X11 clipboard system. This library provides essential functions for getting and
setting UTF-8 text content for both X11's primary selection and clipboard. This
makes it ideal for applications that require straightforward clipboard
interactions without the overhead of more comprehensive libraries.

Features:
* Supports both primary selection and clipboard GetText and SetText operations.
* .NET 8 AOT support

You can find packaged library at [NuGet][nuget_x11clipboard].


## Usage

To write and read X11 primary selection (aka, middle-click clipboard):
```csharp
using System;
using Medo.X11;

X11Clipboard.Primary.SetText("My text.");
Console.WriteLine(X11Clipboard.Primary.GetText());
```

To write and read normal clipboard:
```csharp
using System;
using Medo.X11;

X11Clipboard.Clipboard.SetText("My text.");
Console.WriteLine(X11Clipboard.Clipboard.GetText());
```
